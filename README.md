`osxsub`

A command line utility for using the OS X Text Substitution System Preferences in a unix pipeline. Like `sed` but for Mac users who are taking advantage of a mostly hidden system preference.

Text Substitutions are available for a handful of Mac applications, and can be set up by going to `System Preferences -> Language & Text` and selecting the `Text` tab.

The goals for this program are:

+ Programmatically backup your text substitution preferences, along with the ability to
+ Programmatically load new preferences, so that you can
+ Share substitution preferences across machines, and
+ Have access to them in a greater set of applications, by
+ Allowing Text Substitutions to be a part of your command line toolkit

This is a WIP. Watch this space.
